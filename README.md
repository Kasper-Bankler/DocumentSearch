A simple implementation of TF-IDF.

A simple Python script that computes and prints the top 5 documents by TF-IDF relevance for a given query using NLTK for tokenization and stemming. Added animals.txt, a dataset containing descriptions of various animals, to be used as a demo. The code was developed as part of the course *Introduction to Intelligent Systems (02461)* at DTU.
